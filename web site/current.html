					<p> Since our project is based on improving an already existing algorithm our first step was to profile the bzip2 code. To do this we have used an open source tool called <a href="http://gprof/">GProf (GNU Profiler)</a>. GProf is a profiling program which collects and arranges statistics on a program, by looking into each function and inserting code at the head and tail of each one to collect timing information. However GProf provides the profiling information as command line output which makes it difficult to understand and visualise the profiling data. To help with this we used another open source tool called <a href="http://kprof.sourceforge.net/">KProf</a>. KProf is a visual tool for developers, which displays the execution profiling output generated by code profilers such as GProf. KProf presents the information in list- or tree-views that make the information very easy to understand. </p>

<p>We collected profiling data for bzip2 compression on a pdf (portable document format) document file and an ogv video file and studied the data. </p>

<p>For the sake of version controlling we have set up a <a href="https://github.com/anushree/bzip2-cuda">GitHub project repository</a>. Git is an extremely fast, efficient, distributed version control system ideal for the collaborative development of software. Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. By using git we are able to work separately on the project and share files. Git also keeps tracks of the changes made and the versions of the files updated.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the proposed solution, our major focus is on parallelising the  Burrows-Wheeler transform. We have used a CUDA library called Thrust that contains parallel algorithms with an interface closely resembling the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). Using Thrust we have created a module to perform the Burrows-Wheeler transform. </p>

<p>The basic BWT algorithm is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>function BWT (string s) </li>
<li>create a table, rows are all possible rotations of s </li>
<li>sort rows alphabetically </li>
<li>return (last column of the table) </li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently programming the BWT module using Thrust. We are facing minor issues which will be solved in time.
